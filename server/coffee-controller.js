        description: "The Geisha varietal. It never fails to thrill coffee enthusiasts, and with good reason. One of the most-sought-after varietals in the world, it is also challenging to cultivate. For Cerro Azul—the first Colombian farm to produce it—the quest to deliver this lot involved extensive work with other farms and coffee experts, including trips to countries where the varietal has grown successfully. Cerro Azul revels in its own idyllic microclimate: warm winds from deep valleys meet cooler air from the Pacific, creating ideal day-to-night temperature fluctuations. A product of nature and nurture, this cup stuns with a sweetness that belies its arduous journey.",

        description: "Fifty years ago, a group of smallholder coffee farmers formed a co-op in Naranjo, Costa Rica. The founders came together with a common goal: to develop the local coffee community and improve the livelihoods of their families, friends and neighbors. It was an ambitious mission with extraordinary results. As the co-op grew, it invested in agronomy education, agricultural technology and clean-energy initiatives. The partners worked to establish sustainable practices, elevate crop quality and empower thousands of new members. This incredible group of growers has transformed Naranjo into a renowned origin with a bright future. We’re honored to share their story—and this stunning cup—with you.",

The dew, along with plentiful rainfall and fertile soil, helps create ideal growing conditions. After the harvest, the beans are scrutinized and certified to ensure nothing short of the highest quality. The result: a complex cup with layers of citrus flavor and a hint of cocoa.",

Rich and dark, bold and assertive, these coffees—and the spirit they evoke—are a constant inspiration. So it’s a particular honor to offer this blend in collaboration with Rocco Princi, the legendary artisanal Italian baker with whom we’re so proud to work. To help us develop the perfect companion to his exquisite baked goods, our master blenders worked with Rocco to create a full-bodied, creamy, sweet cup. Bold and forthright yet approachable, Princi™ Blend excels as espresso—an homage to the craft and culture that continue to shape us.",

They thrive in the volcanic soil, while warm equatorial days and cool evenings further nurture them. The agricultural history here is rich. And the clean, delicious flavors that continually emerge from the region prove the farmers’ skill, passion and dedication again and again.

        description: "Starbucks Reserve™ Microblend No. 21, named for nature’s golden ratio, was developed first and foremost as an espresso. But much to our delight, it not only stood up to other brew methods—it brought something new and dynamic to each of them. Guatemalan beans give the blend its rich, chocolaty base—a flavor we’ve come to know and love over the years. And by contrasting that character with a wildly complex Kenyan coffee, we’ve landed on a blend at once familiar and vibrant. Pulled as an espresso shot, it is stunning—the decadence and density of the Guatemalan beans mix beautifully with the savory, candied citrus notes of the Kenyan coffee. Perfect as a doppio, it pairs handsomely with steamed milk in your latte. Frankly, we love this blend unconditionally, a harmoniously balanced composition, good for all occasions.",

        description: "Mt. Kenya—a lone 17,057-foot (5,195-meter) peak jutting out of an expanse of flat grasslands—is stacked with spiraling ecosystems. The mountain’s lower slopes—where the coffee is grown—are surrounded by forests, above which begins a belt of bamboo. Ascending the mountain, the landscape changes over to a timberline forest of small trees and then bushes and hardy grasses. Each zone constitutes its own set of conditions, contributing to the cultivation of beloved coffees, and this returning favorite from the Kangunu washing station is a prime example. It’s a product of farmers working tiny plots of land and hauling their crops to the washing station when the coffee cherries are ripe. Mineral-rich volcanic soil combined with Kangunu’s double-fermentation method has given us a beautifully balanced, vibrantly flavorful cup.",

The winning recipe fuses coffees from two origins—Ethiopia and Guatemala—and excels as cold brew while bringing something revelatory to any brew format. The Guatemalan beans serve as a refined foundation while the sun-dried Ethiopian coffee punctuates it with wild, jammy berry notes. Soft citrus aromas mingle with rich, dark chocolate body and flavor in this sweet, remarkably versatile coffee.",

Anchored by the city of Da Lat—nicknamed “The City of Eternal Spring”—the serene environment of the Lam Dong Province offers an escape from the heat—and ideal conditions for the cultivation of high-quality arabica beans. Coffee grows easily in this beautiful and remote region, but transportation is significantly more difficult. Farmers typically rely on small motorbikes to drive large loads of freshly picked coffee cherries to buying stations. Their dedication culminates in this—a coffee every bit as distinctive as the land from which it came.",

Despite ideal growing conditions, they initially struggled to step out of the shadow of their well-established neighbor, Kona. The tide shifted in 2007 when two Ka`u coffees placed in the top ten at a global cupping competition. Inspired by the results, local advocate Chris Manfredi hired agronomists and consultants to help small-scale farms succeed. Eleven years and many more awards later, Hawaii Ka`u is a coveted micro-origin with a thriving coffee community.",
