        description: "Thousands of years of tea cultivation have laid a deep agricultural foundation in Pu-erh, Yunnan. Standing in compelling contrast to this is Comac Estate, an innovating coffee farm that embraces contemporary experimentation to capture the fullest expression of their beans. Techniques used around the world are prized here: semi-washed processing, which requires extensive training to master and is common in Indonesian coffees; African-style raised-bed drying for humidity control; and experimentation with varietals not often grown in the region. The payoff is a unique lot with comforting flavors of deep-green herbs and rich chocolate, culminating in a malty sweetness. It is the embodiment of an unabashedly new era of Yunnan coffee.",

        description: "The south side of the Big Island is home to the remote district of Ka`u. After the last sugar plantation closed in 1996, farmers looked to coffee as a new source of livelihood. Despite ideal growing conditions, they initially struggled to step out of the shadow of their well-established neighbor, Kona. The tide shifted in 2007 when two Ka`u coffees placed in the top ten at a global cupping competition. Inspired by the results, local advocate Chris Manfredi hired agronomists and consultants to help small-scale farms succeed. Eleven years and many more awards later, Hawaii Ka`u is a coveted micro-origin with a thriving coffee community.",

Lore has it this is where, 1,000 years ago, curious goats gnawed the berries and experienced an energy boost. When a goatherd tried the berries for himself, coffee was discovered. Today Bitta Farm represents one of coffee’s most fabled locations. Reached by a two-day journey over deeply rutted, muddy mountain paths, its wild-grown coffee and direct connection to arabica’s lineage are quite literally the stuff of legend. Along with the distinct flavors highlighted in this small lot, you will experience something more. Each bean is a bit of history.",

The Lubero and Beni districts of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo border the Virunga National Park, an otherworldly spectacle of biological diversity populated with gorillas and chimpanzees. The same mountains that serve as home to these great apes provide superb climate for coffee cultivation—cool nighttime temperatures help the fruit mature slowly and evenly.

Remote and difficult to reach, St. Helena produces a tiny amount of extraordinarily sought-after coffee, including this intriguing micro-lot. Further adding to the lore surrounding these beans, Napoleon is said to have praised the coffee above all else in St. Helena. Coffee is one of the island’s most prized commodities, and with only one harvest each year, every batch is a rarity.

        description: "Starbucks Reserve™ Microblend No. 21, named for nature’s golden ratio, was developed first and foremost as an espresso. But much to our delight, it not only stood up to other brew methods—it brought something new and dynamic to each of them. Guatemalan beans give the blend its rich, chocolaty base—a flavor we’ve come to know and love over the years. And by contrasting that character with a wildly complex Kenyan coffee, we’ve landed on a blend at once familiar and vibrant. Pulled as an espresso shot, it is stunning—the decadence and density of the Guatemalan beans mix beautifully with the savory, candied citrus notes of the Kenyan coffee. Perfect as a doppio, it pairs handsomely with steamed milk in your latte. Frankly, we love this blend unconditionally, a harmoniously balanced composition, good for all occasions.",

The collaboration and hard work of these dedicated farmers truly shine—every sip astounds with a distinct lemon-lime acidity. We’re proud to be offering this coffee for the third year in a row.",

The winning recipe fuses coffees from two origins—Ethiopia and Guatemala—and excels as cold brew while bringing something revelatory to any brew format. The Guatemalan beans serve as a refined foundation while the sun-dried Ethiopian coffee punctuates it with wild, jammy berry notes. Soft citrus aromas mingle with rich, dark chocolate body and flavor in this sweet, remarkably versatile coffee.",
